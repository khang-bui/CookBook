2 teaspoons garlic powder
4 cloves garlic, minced

2) In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat with garlic powder and minced garlic. Set aside.

3) Sprinkle both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.

4) Grill steaks 4 to 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. When done, transfer to warmed plates. Brush tops liberally with garlic butter, and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.
